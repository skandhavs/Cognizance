This is a program to find the n th number in the fibonacci sequence
Initialize n,c (count), a , b and rsp (response) 
DO
	SET a = 0
	SET b = 1
	print
		"ENTER THE VALUE OF n TO FIND n th NUMBER IN FIBONACCI SEQUENCE"
	INPUT n
	FOR " c = 2 to n "          <<count from 2 because 0 and 1 are already known(a and b initially)>>
		IF " c % 2 == 0 "
			a = a + b
		ELSE
			b = a + b
		END IF-ELSE
		c = c + 1
	END FOR
	IF " n % 2 == 0 "
		print a
	ELSE
		print b	
	END IF ELSE
	print
		"If you want to find another number in fibonacci sequence enter yes or else no"
	INPUT rsp
WHILE " rsp == yes "
